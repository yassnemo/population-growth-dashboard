# 🌍 Population Growth Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

The is an interactive web application designed to analyze and visualize population trends over time. Using real-world data, this dashboard provides insights into **population growth rates, demographic shifts, and historical patterns** across different regions. It is built using **Dash and Plotly**, making it highly interactive and user-friendly.

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Interactive Data Visualization** – Explore population trends through dynamic graphs and charts.

✅ **Region-Specific Analysis** – Analyze population growth for different countries and regions.

✅ **Time-Series Data** – View historical population data and future projections.

✅ **Custom Filtering Options** – Filter data by year, region, or specific metrics.

✅ **Built with Dash & Plotly** – Ensures a smooth, interactive experience.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Processing**
   - Reads population data from **CSV files**.
   - Cleans and preprocesses data for visualization.

2. **Dashboard Components**
   - Uses **Dash & Plotly** to generate interactive graphs and tables.
   - Allows users to select specific years and regions to view data trends.

3. **Deployment**
   - Can be deployed on **Heroku, Render, or any cloud platform** that supports Flask/Dash applications.
